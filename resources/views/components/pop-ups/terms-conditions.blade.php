                        This Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between you, the pet owner ("Owner"), and Pet
                        Lodge & Spa, operated by Arca International Investments LLC ("Pet Lodge & Spa" or "we/us/our"),
                        located at [Insert Address], Orlando, Florida. This Agreement constitutes the entire and only
                        agreement between the parties regarding boarding, daycare, grooming, and training services for
                        your pet(s) ("Pet"). There are no oral or implied agreements, and any prior understandings are
                        superseded by this Agreement.
                        Pet Lodge & Spa is committed to providing high-quality care for your Pet in compliance with all
                        applicable Florida state laws (including Florida Statutes Chapter 828 on Animals) and Orange
                        County Code of Ordinances Chapter 5 (Animals), including registration as a commercial kennel
                        under Section 5-40. We prioritize the safety, health, and welfare of all animals in our care.
                        Due to these priorities, we cannot accept Pets that have harmed or shown aggressive behavior
                        toward people or other animals. All male dogs over 1 year of age must be neutered. As an indoor
                        play dog park and socialization facility, all boarding and daycare guests must be socialized; we
                        will evaluate your Pet during the first visit and notify you of any concerns.
                        By signing this Agreement, Owner certifies that: (i) the Pet is in good health and has not been
                        ill with any communicable disease in the 30 days prior to check-in; (ii) if the Pet has been ill
                        within the prior 30 days, Owner will provide a veterinarian's health certification; and (iii)
                        the Pet is protected against internal and external parasites using oral medications (no topical
                        collars or liquid chemicals, to prevent intoxication during interactions). Failure to provide
                        certification or parasite protection may result in denial of services, additional fees, or Owner
                        liability for any resulting issues. We maintain rigorous cleaning and disinfection protocols,
                        but ultimate responsibility for the Pet's health lies with the Owner.
                        <h3>Health and Vaccination Requirements</h3>
                        Proof of current vaccinations must be provided at least 10 days prior to check-in (or
                        overlapping with prior records on file). Florida law (Florida Statutes § 828.30) requires rabies
                        vaccination for all dogs and cats 4 months of age or older. Additional facility requirements
                        align with standard veterinary recommendations for boarding and group care:
                        For Dogs:
                        Rabies (required by Florida law)
                        DHPP/DAPP (Distemper, Hepatitis, Parainfluenza, Parvovirus)
                        Bordetella (Kennel Cough) or equivalent
                        For Cats:
                        Rabies (required by Florida law)
                        FVRCP (Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calicivirus, Panleukopenia)
                        If records are not on file, the full 10-day waiting period applies. We reserve the right to
                        require additional vaccines (e.g., Canine Influenza or Leptospirosis) based on current health
                        risks. Pets showing signs of illness upon arrival will be isolated and may require veterinary
                        clearance at Owner's expense.
                        Boarding and Daycare Services
                        Pet Lodge & Spa provides safe, supervised boarding and daycare for qualifying Pets. Services
                        involve shared spaces and interactions based on size, age, and temperament. Dogs will rotate
                        between private rooms, group yards, and the main yard 3-6 times daily (subject to operational
                        needs). Staff monitor Pets continuously for safety and enrichment. Cats receive private suites
                        with litter, water, toys, scratching posts, and hammocks/beds, with supervised playtime in a
                        dedicated cat area.
                        All activities comply with Orange County standards for commercial kennels, ensuring clean,
                        ventilated enclosures with access to water and exercise (Orange County Code § 5-29 et seq.). We
                        cannot guarantee a fixed number of yard outings due to weather, group dynamics, or facility
                        operations.
                        Grooming Services
                        Owner must disclose if the Pet bites, has bitten, or is aggressive toward people, other animals,
                        or grooming tools. Muzzles may be used for safety. Owner agrees to cover all costs for bites,
                        including medical bills, lost wages, and equipment damage.
                        Grooming can stress senior, ill, or sensitive Pets, potentially revealing or exacerbating health
                        issues. Services for such Pets focus on basic hygiene. Owner assumes all risks, including injury
                        or death during/after grooming, and waives any claims against us. If fleas/ticks are detected at
                        check-in or during grooming, a flea bath and isolation will be required (additional fee
                        applies). Ticks will be removed with potential extra charges.
                        Groomers may refuse service or adjust pricing based on behavior, health, age, or complexity. In
                        case of accidents, our insurance covers eligible costs; if not, Owner is responsible.
                        Training Services
                        We offer group (6-week program, 1 class/week, up to 6 dogs) and private (1-hour sessions)
                        training focused on basics, tricks, and behavior. Owner attendance is required for group
                        classes; missed classes are non-refundable and non-reschedulable. Private sessions target
                        specific needs and may be recommended alongside group classes.
                        Training success depends on Owner's consistent follow-through with homework. We provide
                        guidance, but results vary. In case of accidents affecting the Pet or Owner, our insurance
                        covers eligible costs; if not, Owner is responsible.
                        Payment, Deposits, and Cancellation
                        Rates are as posted on the check-in date; special requests incur additional fees.
                        Full payment due at pickup; no Pet release until paid. We accept cash, credit, or debit cards
                        only—no checks.
                        A $50 non-refundable deposit is required for holidays/long weekends/busy seasons. Cancellations
                        within 48 hours of check-in forfeit the deposit.
                        Late pickups (beyond agreed date) incur daily boarding fees. After 5 days, the Pet may be
                        surrendered to Orange County Animal Services at Owner's expense.
                        Unpaid charges grant us a lien on the Pet under Florida law (Florida Statutes § 705.19); we may
                        enforce after 30 days' notice, including collection costs and attorney's fees.
                        Liability, Insurance, and Emergency Care
                        Pet Lodge & Spa exercises reasonable care per Florida animal welfare laws (Florida Statutes
                        Chapter 828) and Orange County standards, including daily monitoring, feeding, and sanitation.
                        However, Owner assumes all risks of injury, illness, death, escape, theft, or damage caused
                        by/to the Pet. This includes liability for bites (strict liability under Florida Statutes §
                        767.04) and any harm to third parties.
                        Our insurance covers accidents, illnesses, or injuries during services; if denied, Owner pays
                        all costs. In emergencies, we will attempt to contact Owner immediately via provided info. If
                        unreachable, we may seek veterinary care at the nearest facility and administer treatments.
                        Owner is responsible for all vet bills plus a $100 handling fee.
                        We are not liable for lost/damaged personal items, pre-existing conditions, or communicable
                        diseases. Owner warrants sole ownership and full disclosure of Pet history.
                        Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
                        This Agreement is governed by Florida law. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the
                        courts of Orange County, Florida. The prevailing party recovers reasonable attorney's fees and
                        costs.
                        This Agreement binds heirs, assigns, and representatives. If any provision is unenforceable, the
                        remainder remains valid. No waiver of terms applies.
                        Additional Provisions:
                        No responsibility for lost/stolen/damaged items.
                        No refunds for missed training classes; outcomes depend on Owner participation.
                        $2 daily insurance fee applies to all services.
                        Owner consents to facility photos/videos of Pet for promotional use (no identifying info).
                        By signing, Owner acknowledges reading, understanding, and agreeing to these terms.

# View Check-in Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis
- **Controller**: `viewCheckIn` method in `CheckInController.php` is already implemented correctly (lines 60-66)
- **Current View**: `view-check-in.blade.php` is currently a submission form, not a summary view
- **Data Structure**: Uses `SummaryRenderer.js` for rendering check-in summaries with cookie-based data persistence
- **Models**: `CheckIn` has relationship with `Pet` model via `with('pet')`

## Required Changes

### 1. Modify view-check-in.blade.php
- Replace submission form with check-in summary display
- Loop through `$checkIns` collection
- Display each check-in with pet details
- Add edit button for each check-in

### 2. Edit Button Functionality
- Each edit button should redirect to check-in form (`/new-form-pre-filled`)
- Pass check-in data via cookie/session for pre-population
- Include pet details, feeding, medication, inventory, etc.

### 3. Data Display Structure
- Use similar structure to `SummaryRenderer.js` but server-side rendered
- Show pet information from `CheckIn->pet` relationship
- Include check-in date/time
- Display feeding and medication schedules
- Show inventory items
- Include grooming services

### 4. Cookie/Session Handling
- Store check-in data in cookie when edit button is clicked
- Pre-populate form fields on redirect to `/new-form-pre-filled`

## Implementation Steps
1. Update Blade template to display check-in summaries
2. Add edit buttons with JavaScript for cookie storage
3. Ensure proper data formatting matches existing form structure
4. Test with sample data to verify display
